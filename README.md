App for Tracking Personal Expenses:
--> This project aims to provide a Python application that assists with budgeting by allowing the user to track and organise their monthly spending. 
--> Users can enter the category and quantity of their expenses straight into the terminal by using the app. --> After that, an expense entry will be saved (appended) to a file. 
--> Lastly, review the file to get an overview of the monthly spending totals.

App Needs:

--> Request that the user add an expense (amount, name, and category).
--> Store the cost entries in a CSV file. 
--> Check the file for a summary.
